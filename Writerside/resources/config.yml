# How many Honeypots to store in cache at any given time.
# Caching Honeypots stores Honeypot data in-memory, reducing PDC/SQLite queries when breaking Honeypots to retrieve information.
# Setting this to <= 0 will disable caching, slightly decreasing memory usage slightly but also *very* slightly increasing tick times
# Please see https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/wiki#faq for more info. If you don't know what this is, leave it alone

# This is an experimental setting, testing PDC support for Honeypot. PDC is a Spigot API which allows for storing data directly in the NBT of certain objects

# This is an experimental setting which enables the ability for a third-party storage manager to be used with Honeypot. This is not recommended for most users.
# Developers can create their own storage manager to store Honeypot data in if they don't like SQLite or PDC. This allows things like MySQL, H2, PostgreSQL, etc. to be added later on
# If you are a developer and want to use this, please refer to the wiki. Defaults to false.
