migrate:
  preconfirm: This command will migrate the Honeypot database to PDC, a much faster and more efficient storage type. It is not possible to switch back once migrated. You are REQUIRED to restart your server afterwards for Honeypot to continue working. Enter "/honeypot migrate confirm" to continue
  confirm: Migration is completed! Honeypot has been shutdown, please restart your server as soon as possible for this change to take effect. If you need to switch back, your DB has been left in tact.
