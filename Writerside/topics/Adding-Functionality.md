# Develop with Honeypot

## Creating custom actions

1. Create your Custom Action in the honeypots.yml file (
   See [this page](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/wiki/Creating-Custom-Actions) for more info)
2. Type `/honeypot create <action name>`. Enabled behavior providers (Including the built-in ones) and custom actions
   will be displayed in the same list. Action Name will tab-complete based on values in the config! Remember, Behavior
   Providers take precedence over custom actions.
3. You may also use the GUI to create custom actions.
   See [this page](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/wiki/Creating-Custom-Actions#icons) for info one what each
   icon means in the GUI.
