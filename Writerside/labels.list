    <secondary-label id="uses-dependency" name="Uses Dependencies" color="tangerine">This feature uses 3rd party
        plugin dependencies for some or all parts of its functionality. Please be sure to closely consult the Wiki to
        ensure these dependencies are met. Without these other plugins, utilizing these features may cause Honeypot to
        silently fail or exhibit unexpected behavior.
